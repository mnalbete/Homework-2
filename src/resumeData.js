My reasons to become a full stack developer is that when starting this course I had no idea what to expect wether I would enjoy the course or hate it. But I can say that I really enjoy the course. Although the course toward the end is tough and when I mean tough I mean tough I still try and try but never give up. Even in failer will I succeed. For me that makes me want to do this is the fact of creating something is for me the best thing and the best reword.",
