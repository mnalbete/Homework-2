               <p> Hello! My name is Mathew Naogi Kaeo Albete and I currently live in Seattle, Washington. A little history about me is that I was born on the small island of Maui which if you dont know is located in Hawaii. I ended up in Seattle because I wanted to move to the West coast after I finished my military carrer. I was never stationed anywhere near the west coast so I am glad to be back on the west coast once again. For those of you wondering I did 9 years of survice in the United States Army. Once I got out I started my carreer in the food services which I have my Assosiates degree in food science. I am here in coding school to learn something new and fun. I also am looking to change my carreer path so that one day I can start programing my own things. This road will be long and hard but I will take on any challenge whatever it may be.
                    </p>
